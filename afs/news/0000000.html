                <a>Magic on Earth was omnipresent and wars were growing in consistency. Magic was running amok with power hungry thaumaturge ruining Earth as it was known. This renaissance era of magic and science had taken a turn for the worse as information in free flow was taken advantage of and abused by darker forces. 
        <br><br>
                
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
                The year was 1543 and a well known mathematician and astronomer, Nicolaus Copernicus, had published a book that would change the current and future world to come. The publication was &#8216;On the Revolution of Heavenly Bodies&#8217; and the tome had caused some mages to harness the power of the sun and the planets (Heaven&#8217;s Magic.) Through detrimental trial and error, it took some years before mages were able to use it correctly.
        <br><br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
                A Fracture of time was caused by The Four Great Lords in order to preserve the potential of a future. The powerful mages were in agreement that the timeline was headed toward infinite darkness with constantly increasing wars and thus combined their magic in order to save the world, or rather, a version of the world. Two lords stayed in the original world with magic and the other two moved into a portal with the new timeline with almost all magic stripped from it. 
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
                In the very same moment before The Fracture, a notorious villain named Abyss attempted a similar event. He was also studying Heaven&#8217;s Magic and was not powerful enough to use it correctly. He did so regardless. Without proper knowledge he went on to attempt his own Fracture, but was unsuccessful in his attempt. Instead, he had created a portal to his own separate timeline and was sucked into it. Before he was sucked into his timeline, he had a window of opportunity to create another portal to the non magic timeline. He was successful in this attempt and created an artifact, which his soul was tied to, and threw it into the portal of the non magic timeline. His timeline was an empty void where he had nothing but time to divulge into magic.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
                After The Fracture, Magic was thought to be separated in the timelines. Earth had split into two different timelines. They are still connected but remain separate due to the powerful magic “lock” keeping them apart. 
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
                The original timeline continued as it was going to be. With wars wiping out at least half of the population and having deeply disturbed animal&#8217;s evolution creating a mutated version of its past self. The world is post-apocalypse almost 500 years later with some life beaconing with the darkness and magic.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
                The duplicate timeline is the timeline that you or I know. Most magic was stripped from the world and people. Memories were rewritten. What we know today is just a figment of what the Four Great Lords created.
